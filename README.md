# Fuzzy-Logic

Introduction -
In this project, we have used one of the soft computing technique i.e. Fuzzy Logic. Fuzzy Logic is defined as the multi-valued logic i.e. the logic may vary from 0 to 1 and both 0 and 1 being inclusive. It is done to bring out more accuracy in the performance of a particular system. It is developed to handle the concept of partial truth where the truth value may range between a pure truth value to a pure false value. It enhances the features of a particular logic been implemented in real life examples. 

Enhancing to our project, we have traced back to late 90’s where Holland’s Theory came into existence which deals with the career choices i.e. making a choice to a career. It helped in classifying the right choice for a career. According to the theory of Holland, it has six main criteria to make a career choice, these choices are depicted by the given picture below. But for our project we have opted for 5 main categories out of six. 

Each domain of interest has various sub categories which are:

1.	Investigative: It includes traits like curious, intelligent
2.	Artistic: It includes traits like idealistic, unconventional 
3.	Social: It includes traits like supportive, patient 
4.	Enterprising: It includes traits like persuasive, ambitious 
5.	Realistic: It includes traits like practical, stable

                                                              
With these sub-categories of five major domains, our project helps an individual in predicting his / her area of interest.  

Inputs -
In the project, “Interest Recommendation System” we have used five different interests and they are as follows -
1.	Investigative  
2.	Artistic
3.	Social
4.	Realistic
5.	Enterprising

Libraries Used – 
1.	Scikit - Fuzzy – 

•	Scikit-Fuzzy is a collection of fuzzy logic algorithms intended for use in the SciPy Stack, written in the Python computing language. This package implements many useful tools and functions for computation and projects involving fuzzy logic.

2.	Numpy –

•	It is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

3.	Matplotlib –

•	It is a python library used to create 2D graphs and plots by using python scripts. It has a module named pyplot which makes things easy for plotting by providing feature to control line styles, font properties, formatting axes etc.
